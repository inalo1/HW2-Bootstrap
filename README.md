# Portfolio Summary
Used the Bootstrap CSS to design my own personal portfolio.

## Overview 
CSS frameworks allow us to quickly style a web application so we can focus on **bootstrapping** it (i.e., building and deploying the business logic). Most CSS frameworks handle the more challenging aspects of CSS for us, such as floats and media queries. Another benefit of using CSS frameworks is that it ensures consistency across applications. Depending on your career trajectory, you may find yourself maintaining multiple web applications and, as you learned in the previous unit, CSS can get unruly very quickly. As applications scale, being able to easily maintain and organize your codebase becomes very important.

The CSS framework used in thin this portfolio is Bootstrap. Bootstrap was one of the first CSS frameworks and is, at the time of this writing, the most widely used in production. It was created by the developers at Twitter for the reasons discussed above and released as an open source project in 2011, meaning anyone could use it in their applications for free. There are dozens of CSS frameworks to choose from now. Learning Bootstrap will set you up to quickly adapt to almost any framework as they tend to share the same underlying concept of a grid system structured by rows and columns.
